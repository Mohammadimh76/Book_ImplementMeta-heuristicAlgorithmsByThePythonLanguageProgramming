## "Metaheuristic with python" 🔺(Coming Soon)🔺


---

## Introduction:
In recent years, the use of meta-heuristic algorithms has expanded significantly in solving complex computational problems, and today it has many applications in various branches of science. They may be close to the global optimum.<br>
The present book is an attempt to present the concepts of meta-heuristic algorithms, their implementation and applications, consisting of 6 main chapters and two comprehensive appendices. The first chapter of the book contains an overview of optimization methods and familiarity with the components and classification of different types of optimization problems. Chapters 2 through 6 cover refrigeration simulation algorithms, forbidden search, genetic algorithms, ant colony optimization, and particle mass optimization. Appendix (a) also includes a step-by-step tutorial on Python software that students will gain the necessary mastery of Python software by reading and practicing this chapter. Appendix (b) also provides programming related to widely used algorithms.<br>
It is hoped that this small effort will be used by respected scholars and will improve their scientific level. We ask all the dear readers to help the authors of the book in eliminating the shortcomings and improving the presented materials by sending their constructive suggestions and criticisms.<br>

Iam currently a Final-year BS.c student at the Department of Computer Engineering, Islamic Azad University, Najafabad Branch (IAUN) (Rank in CWUR) where I am a member of the Bioinformatics Laboratory (BL), advised by Prof. Mohammad Naderi Dehkordi. my research involves machine vision, deep learning, and neural networks. where I will complete my thesis on Accurate and Early Identification of Diabetes and it's Affecting Factors.

Prior to BL, I finished my Diploma - Mathematics and Physics in Sheikh Ansari Highschool, in September 2015. I tried to use my Diploma to build a solid bedrock for my future research. So in addition to taking many optional bachelor-level courses on math and computer science. I spent 6 months as an intern Programmer at the "CoTech" in Isfahan.
